# Hi!

I am Mob. Yoroshiku!
19 y.o
I like to explore a lot of things!
Currently, I explore about personality types, like MBTI typology.
I'm an INFJ-T, _'what a complex personality!'_' it's said.
I've also been learning about Jungian cognitive functions and other typology methods as well.
Personally I feel, it's harder to understand self than others.
I hope whoever is reading this will have a great day! :)
Peace out!

My current typology profile is:
